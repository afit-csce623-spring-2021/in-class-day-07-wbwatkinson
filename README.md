# Overview


In this coding activity, you'll develop plots of a logistic curve to achieve several different shapes.

# Instructions

1. Obtain the STUDENT code from the repository
2. Implement the Logistic1D function from its math formula
3. Complete the coding step to select betas for the canonical S curve
4. Complete the coding step to select betas for the Stairstep down function
5. Run the code and check your work against the SOLUTION.


# Helpful Tips

- When you open the file, you'll see a static file. You have several options to interact with the notebook.
  - Colab Notebooks: To use Colab, you'll want to change the URL domain from `github.com` to `githubtocolab.com` and leave everything else the same. You can save your changes back to GitHub with **File -> Save a copy in GitHub**. The save dialog will allow you to select a repository and file name. In most cases, you will not need to change these values. You may also provide a commit message. Providing a memorable commit message can help you compare your progress to the auto test results provided by GitHub.
  - Local development: You may also develop locally. Use the `git clone` command to procure a local copy of the repository. To test your progress, you may periodically commit your changes locally and push them to the remote GitHub repository so that GitHub can run auto test results.
